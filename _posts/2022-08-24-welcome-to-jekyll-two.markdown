The goal of this article is to add some extra info
about blog writing with _Jekyll_.

## Structure your posts

Use level 2 (`##`) and if necessary level 3 (`###`) titles
to structure your posts.

## Display code snippets

You can display a block of code like the following using triple backticks.
You can also specify the language after the first triple backticks.

```python
def hello(name):
    return f'hello {name}'
```

## Add images

$$
\left(\vec{\alpha}\right)
=
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    2 \\
    0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Create an `assets` folder where you can put all your images,
then display them with a link starting with an exclamative mark like this:
`![my inspiring image]({{ "/assets/sample-image.jpg" | relative_url }})`.
